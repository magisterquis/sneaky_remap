Quickstart (C)
===============
This is the code behind the the main README's
[C Quickstart](../README.md##quickstart-c).

It's a simple shared object file which prints the memory maps after
everything's hidden and then closes file descriptor 4 so bash doesn't exit
before C's threads have time to catch up.

Running
-------
Be in this directory and run `bmake`.

The output should look like
```
```
